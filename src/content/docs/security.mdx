import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Slink supports user authentication and user approval to prevent unauthorized access to the application. However, it's recommended to use a reverse proxy like [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/) or [Traefik](https://traefik.io/traefik/)
to add additional security features like SSL, rate limiting, etc.

<Aside type="caution" title="Important">
  Be aware that as of now, the application does not have any built-in rate
  limiting or brute force protection.
</Aside>

<Aside type="tip">
  If you don't want to expose the entire application to the public, you can only
  expose the `/image` route via the reverse proxy.

## Non-Root Container User

By default, the application runs as the `root` user inside the container. However, it's recommended to run the application as a [non-root user](/reference/04-non-root-container-user) for security reasons.
