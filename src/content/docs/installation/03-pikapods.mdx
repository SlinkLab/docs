[PikaPods](https://www.pikapods.com/) is a managed hosting platform that makes it easy to run open-source applications with minimal setup. Deploy Slink on PikaPods with just one click and let them handle the infrastructure.

[![Run on PikaPods](https://www.pikapods.com/static/run-button.svg)](https://www.pikapods.com/pods?run=slink)

## Configuration

<Aside type="caution" title="Important">
  When deploying on PikaPods, you should configure the admin user environment
  variables to automatically create your first admin account. This is the
  easiest way to get started with your Slink instance.
</Aside>

### Admin User Setup

During deployment, configure the following environment variables to automatically create your admin user:

- `ADMIN_EMAIL` - Email address for the admin account (e.g., `admin@example.com`)
- `ADMIN_PASSWORD` - Password for the admin account (must meet password requirements)
- `ADMIN_USERNAME` - Username for the admin account (optional, defaults to `admin`)

<Aside type="tip">
  For a complete list of available environment variables and configuration
  options, see the [Environment
  Variables](/configuration/01-environment-variables/) reference page.
</Aside>

## After Deployment

<Steps>

1. Once deployment is complete, PikaPods will provide you with a URL to access your Slink instance.

2. Navigate to your instance URL and log in with the admin credentials you configured.

3. Start uploading and sharing images!

4. Customize your instance settings through the admin panel or by updating environment variables in the PikaPods dashboard.

</Steps>
