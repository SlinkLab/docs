import { Steps, Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed on your system.

## Installation

<Aside type="caution" title="Important">
  Make sure to replace `https://your-domain.com` with your actual domain name.
  Also, ensure that the `TZ` environment variable is set to your timezone.
</Aside>

<Steps>

1. Create a new directory for Slink and navigate to it:

   ```bash
   mkdir slink-app && cd slink-app
   ```

2. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file with the following content:

   ```yaml
   services:
     slink:
       image: anirdev/slink:latest
       container_name: slink
       environment:
         # Your timezone
         - TZ=UTC

         # Your application hostname (Required for cookies)
         - ORIGIN=https://your-domain.com

         # Require user approval before they can upload images
         - USER_APPROVAL_REQUIRED=true

         # User password requirements
         - USER_PASSWORD_MIN_LENGTH=8
         - USER_PASSWORD_REQUIREMENTS=15 # bitmask of requirements

         # Maximum image size allowed to be uploaded (no more than 50M)
         - IMAGE_MAX_SIZE=15M

         # Image processing settings
         - IMAGE_STRIP_EXIF_METADATA=true
         - IMAGE_COMPRESSION_QUALITY=80

         # Storage provider to use (may require additional configuration variables for different providers, see below)
         - STORAGE_PROVIDER=local
       volumes:
         # Persist the database
         - ./slink/var/data:/app/var/data
         # Persist the uploaded images
         - ./slink/images:/app/slink/images
       ports:
         # Expose the application on port 3000
         - '3000:3000'
   ```

3. Run the following command to start the Slink application:

   ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. (Optional) Grant yourself admin access by running the following command:

   ```bash
   docker exec -it slink slink user:grant:role --email=<user-email> ROLE_ADMIN
   ```

5. Open your browser and navigate to [https://your-domain.com:3000/profile/signup](https://your-domain.com:3000/profile/signup) to create a new account.

6. Login to the Slink application and start uploading images.

## Advanced Configuration Examples

### SMB/Network Storage Configuration

If you want to store images on a network share using SMB/CIFS:

```yaml
services:
  slink:
    image: anirdev/slink:latest
    container_name: slink
    environment:
      - TZ=UTC
      - ORIGIN=https://your-domain.com
      
      # SMB Storage Configuration
      - STORAGE_PROVIDER=smb
      - SMB_HOST=192.168.1.100
      - SMB_SHARE=slink-storage
      - SMB_USERNAME=slink-user
      - SMB_PASSWORD=secure-password
      - SMB_WORKGROUP=workgroup
      
      # Other settings...
      - USER_APPROVAL_REQUIRED=true
      - IMAGE_MAX_SIZE=15M
    volumes:
      # Only need to persist the database when using SMB storage
      - ./slink/var/data:/app/var/data
    ports:
      - '3000:3000'
```

### Amazon S3 Storage Configuration

For cloud deployments using AWS S3:

```yaml
services:
  slink:
    image: anirdev/slink:latest
    container_name: slink
    environment:
      - TZ=UTC
      - ORIGIN=https://your-domain.com
      
      # S3 Storage Configuration
      - STORAGE_PROVIDER=s3
      - AMAZON_S3_REGION=us-east-1
      - AMAZON_S3_BUCKET=my-slink-bucket
      - AMAZON_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=EXAMPLEKEYID
      - AMAZON_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=exampleSecretKey
      
      # Other settings...
      - USER_APPROVAL_REQUIRED=true
      - IMAGE_MAX_SIZE=15M
    volumes:
      # Only need to persist the database when using S3 storage
      - ./slink/var/data:/app/var/data
    ports:
      - '3000:3000'
```

  Never commit AWS credentials to version control. Consider using AWS IAM roles, AWS Secrets Manager, or Docker secrets for production deployments.
