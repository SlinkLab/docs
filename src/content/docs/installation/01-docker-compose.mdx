import { Steps, Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed on your system.

## Installation

<Aside type="caution" title="Important">
  Make sure to replace `https://your-domain.com` with your actual domain name.
  Also, ensure that the `TZ` environment variable is set to your timezone.

<Steps>

1. Create a new directory for Slink and navigate to it:

   ```bash
   mkdir slink-app && cd slink-app
   ```

2. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file with the following content:

   ```yaml
   services:
     slink:
       image: anirdev/slink:latest
       container_name: slink
       environment:
         # Your timezone
         - TZ=UTC

         # Your application hostname (Required for cookies)
         - ORIGIN=https://your-domain.com

         # Require user approval before they can upload images
         - USER_APPROVAL_REQUIRED=true

         # User password requirements
         - USER_PASSWORD_MIN_LENGTH=8
         - USER_PASSWORD_REQUIREMENTS=15 # bitmask of requirements

         # Maximum image size allowed to be uploaded (no more than 50M)
         - IMAGE_MAX_SIZE=15M

         # Storage provider to use (may require additional configuration variables for different providers, see below)
         - STORAGE_PROVIDER=local
       volumes:
         # Persist the database
         - ./slink/var/data:/app/var/data
         # Persist the uploaded images
         - ./slink/images:/app/slink/images
       ports:
         # Expose the application on port 3000
         - '3000:3000'
   ```

3. Run the following command to start the Slink application:

   ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. (Optional) Grant yourself admin access by running the following command:

   ```bash
   docker exec -it slink slink user:grant:role --email=<user-email> ROLE_ADMIN
   ```

5. Open your browser and navigate to [https://your-domain.com:3000/profile/signup](https://your-domain.com:3000/profile/signup) to create a new account.

6. Login to the Slink application and start uploading images.

</Steps>

<Aside type="note">
  You can customize the `docker-compose.yml` file to suit your needs. For
  example, you can change the `IMAGE_MAX_SIZE` to allow larger or smaller images
  to be uploaded. Please refer to the
  [configuration](/configuration/01-environment-variables) section for more
  details.
</Aside>

<Aside type="tip">
  If you are using Traefik, you don't need to expose the application on port
  3000. You can use Traefik to route the traffic to the application by adding
  the corresponding labels to the service.
