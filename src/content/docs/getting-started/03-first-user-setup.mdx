After installing Slink, you need to create your first admin user. There are two approaches: automatic creation via environment variables (recommended for new installations) or manual setup using CLI commands.

## Automatic Admin User Creation

<Aside type="tip">
  The easiest way to set up your first admin user is to configure it during initial deployment using environment variables.
</Aside>

When deploying Slink for the first time, you can preconfigure the first admin user using environment variables. This eliminates the need to manually activate users or assign admin roles via CLI commands after installation.

### How It Works

On the first container startup, if the `ADMIN_EMAIL` environment variable is set, Slink will automatically:
1. Create a new user account with the specified credentials
2. Assign the admin role to the user
3. Activate the account (bypassing approval requirements)

### Configuration

Set the following environment variables in your Docker Compose file or Docker run command:

```yaml
environment:
  - ADMIN_USERNAME=administrator
  - ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@yourdomain.com
  - ADMIN_PASSWORD=YourSecurePassword123
```

| Variable | Description | Default | Required |
|----------|-------------|---------|----------|
| `ADMIN_EMAIL` | Email address for the admin user. This triggers automatic admin creation. | `null` | Yes |
| `ADMIN_USERNAME` | Username for the admin user. | `admin` | No |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Password for the admin user. | `null` | Yes |

### Complete Docker Compose Example

```yaml
services:
  slink:
    image: anirdev/slink:latest
    container_name: slink
    environment:
      - TZ=UTC
      - ORIGIN=https://your-domain.com
      
      # Admin user configuration (remove after first startup)
      - ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
      - ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@yourdomain.com
      - ADMIN_PASSWORD=YourSecurePassword123
      
      # Other settings...
      - USER_APPROVAL_REQUIRED=true
      - IMAGE_MAX_SIZE=15M
    volumes:
      - ./slink/var/data:/app/var/data
      - ./slink/images:/app/slink/images
    ports:
      - '3000:3000'
```

<Aside type="caution">
  After the initial setup is complete, it's recommended to remove the admin credentials from your environment configuration for security purposes.
</Aside>

## Manual User Setup

If you prefer to set up your first user manually, or if you didn't configure the admin environment variables during installation, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Create a User Account

1. Open your browser and navigate to the signup page: `https://your-domain.com/profile/signup`
2. Fill in the registration form with your details
3. Submit the form to create your account

### Step 2: Activate Your Account

If you have `USER_APPROVAL_REQUIRED=true` in your configuration, your account needs to be activated before you can log in:

```bash
docker exec -it slink slink user:activate --email=<your-email>
```

### Step 3: Grant Admin Role

Grant yourself admin privileges:

```bash
docker exec -it slink slink user:grant:role --email=<your-email> ROLE_ADMIN
```

### Step 4: Log In

Navigate to the login page and use your credentials to access the application as an admin user.
