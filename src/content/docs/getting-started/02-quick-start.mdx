   ```bash
   docker run -d \
    --name slink \
    -p 3000:3000 \
    -v ./slink/var/data:/app/var/data \
    -v ./slink/images:/app/slink/images \
    -e ORIGIN=https://your-domain.com \
    -e USER_APPROVAL_REQUIRED=false \
    anirdev/slink:latest
   ```

3. Open your browser and navigate to [https://your-domain.com:3000/profile/signup](https://your-domain.com:3000/profile/signup) to create a new account.

4. (Optional) Grant yourself admin access by running the following command:

  The example command disables [user approval](/reference/01-approve-user). It's
  recommended to enable user approval in production environments.
