import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Slink supports multiple storage providers for storing images. By default, the application uses the local file system to store images. However, you can configure the application to use a different storage provider by setting the `STORAGE_PROVIDER` [environment variable](/configuration/01-environment-variables).

<Aside type="note">
  The following storage providers are supported: `local`, `smb` and `s3`.

<Aside type="caution">
  To persist locally saved images, you need to mount the `/app/slink/images`
  directory to the host filesystem.
