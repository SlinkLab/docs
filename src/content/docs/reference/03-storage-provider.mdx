import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Slink supports multiple storage providers for storing images. By default, the application uses the local file system to store images. However, you can configure the application to use a different storage provider by setting the `STORAGE_PROVIDER` [environment variable](/configuration/01-environment-variables).

<Aside type="note">
  The following storage providers are supported: `local`, `smb` and `s3`.
</Aside>

## Local Storage Provider

The local storage provider stores images on the local filesystem. This is the default provider and requires no additional configuration beyond specifying the storage directory.

<Aside type="caution">
  To persist locally saved images when using Docker, you need to mount the `/app/slink/images`
  directory to the host filesystem.
</Aside>

**Configuration:**
- `STORAGE_PROVIDER=local`
- Images are stored in `/app/slink/images`
- Cache files are stored in `/app/slink/cache`

## SMB (Samba) Storage Provider

The SMB storage provider allows you to store images on a network share using the SMB/CIFS protocol. This is useful for centralized storage in enterprise environments.

**Required Configuration:**
- `STORAGE_PROVIDER=smb`
- `SMB_HOST` - The hostname or IP address of your SMB server
- `SMB_SHARE` - The name of the SMB share to use
- `SMB_USERNAME` - Username for authentication
- `SMB_PASSWORD` - Password for authentication

**Optional Configuration:**
- `SMB_WORKGROUP` - The SMB workgroup (defaults to 'workgroup')

**Example Docker Compose configuration:**
```yaml
environment:
  STORAGE_PROVIDER: smb
  SMB_HOST: 192.168.1.100
  SMB_SHARE: slink-storage
  SMB_USERNAME: slink-user
  SMB_PASSWORD: your-secure-password
  SMB_WORKGROUP: workgroup
```

<Aside type="note">
  The SMB provider automatically creates the required directory structure (`slink/images` and `slink/cache`) on the remote share.
</Aside>

## Amazon S3 Storage Provider

The Amazon S3 storage provider stores images in an AWS S3 bucket. This is ideal for cloud deployments and provides scalable object storage.

**Required Configuration:**
- `STORAGE_PROVIDER=s3`
- `AMAZON_S3_REGION` - AWS region where your bucket is located (e.g., `us-east-1`)
- `AMAZON_S3_BUCKET` - Name of your S3 bucket
- `AMAZON_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID` - AWS access key ID
- `AMAZON_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` - AWS secret access key

**Example Docker Compose configuration:**
```yaml
environment:
  STORAGE_PROVIDER: s3
  AMAZON_S3_REGION: us-east-1
  AMAZON_S3_BUCKET: my-slink-bucket
  AMAZON_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID: EXAMPLEKEYID
  AMAZON_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: exampleSecretKey
```

<Aside type="tip">
  For security best practices, consider using IAM roles instead of access keys when running on AWS infrastructure, or use AWS Secrets Manager for credential management.
</Aside>

<Aside type="note">
  The S3 provider stores images directly in the bucket root with the following structure:
  - Original images: `{filename}`
  - Cached/transformed images: `cache/{transformed-filename}`
</Aside>

## Storage Provider Architecture

Slink uses a proxy pattern to abstract storage operations. The `StorageProxy` class automatically routes operations to the configured storage provider based on the `STORAGE_PROVIDER` environment variable.

**Supported Operations:**
- Upload files with automatic directory creation
- Read and write file content
- Delete files
- Check file existence
- Image transformation and caching

**Directory Structure:**
All storage providers maintain a consistent directory structure:
- `slink/images/` - Original uploaded images
- `slink/cache/` - Transformed/cached images
