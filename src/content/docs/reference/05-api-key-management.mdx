API keys provide a secure way to authenticate with Slink's API for external integrations and automated uploads. They're perfect for tools like ShareX or custom scripts that need to upload images programmatically.

## Creating API Keys

<Steps>

1. **Navigate to Your Profile**
   
   Go to your user profile page and click on the "API Keys" tab.

2. **Create New API Key**
   
   Click the "Create API Key" button to open the creation dialog.

3. **Configure Your Key**
   
   - **Name**: Give your API key a descriptive name (e.g., "ShareX Upload Key", "Automation Script")
   - **Expiry Date** (Optional): Set an expiration date for enhanced security, or leave empty for a permanent key

4. **Save and Store Securely**
   
   Once created, copy and store your API key immediately. It will only be shown once and cannot be recovered if lost.

</Steps>

<Aside type="caution" title="Security Warning">
  API keys provide full access to upload images on your behalf. Store them securely and never share them publicly. If a key is compromised, revoke it immediately.
</Aside>

## Using API Keys

API keys are used in the `Authorization` header with the `Bearer` prefix:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_your_api_key_here" \
  -F "image=@/path/to/your/image.jpg" \
  https://your-slink-instance.com/api/external/upload
```

### API Endpoints

**Upload Image:**
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/external/upload`
- **Authentication**: Required (API Key)
- **Body**: Multipart form data with `image` field
- **Response**: JSON with image URL and metadata

**ShareX Integration:**
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/user/sharex-config?baseUrl=<url>&apiKey=<key>`
- **Authentication**: Required (User login)
- **Response**: ShareX configuration file (.sxcu)

## ShareX Integration

Slink provides built-in ShareX integration for seamless screenshot and image uploads.

### Automatic Configuration

1. **Create an API Key** (see steps above)
2. **Download ShareX Config**
   
   After creating a new API key, click "Download ShareX Config" to get a pre-configured `.sxcu` file.

3. **Import to ShareX**
   
   Double-click the downloaded `.sxcu` file or import it manually in ShareX under:
   `Destinations → Custom uploaders → Import → From file`

### Manual ShareX Configuration

If you prefer manual setup:

1. Open ShareX and go to `Destinations → Custom uploaders`
2. Click `New` to create a new uploader
3. Configure the following settings:
   - **Name**: Slink
   - **Method**: POST
   - **Request URL**: `https://your-slink-instance.com/api/external/upload`
   - **Headers**: `Authorization: Bearer your_api_key_here`
   - **Body**: `Form data (multipart/form-data)`
   - **File form name**: `image`
   - **URL**: `$json:url$`

## Security Best Practices

### Key Management
- **Use descriptive names** to identify where each key is used
- **Set expiration dates** for keys used in temporary or testing scenarios
- **Rotate keys regularly** for enhanced security
- **Revoke unused keys** to minimize attack surface

### Access Control
- **One key per application** - Don't share keys between different tools or scripts
- **Monitor usage** - Check the "Last Used" field to identify inactive keys
- **Environment variables** - Store API keys in environment variables, not in code

### Key Storage
- **Never commit to version control** - Add API keys to your `.gitignore`
- **Use secure storage** - Consider using password managers or secure vaults
- **Limit access** - Only share keys with team members who need them
