title: Non-Root Container User
description: Running the application as a non-root user for security reasons.

By default, the application runs as the `root` user inside the container. However, it's recommended to run the application as a non-root user for security reasons.
While Slink cannot enforce this, additional steps are required to run the application as a non-root user:

<Steps>

1. Create persistent directories on the host machine:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p /path/to/slink/images
   mkdir -p /path/to/slink/data
   ```

2. Change ownership of the directories to correspond to container user:

   ```bash
   chown -R 1000:1000 /path/to/slink
   ```

3. Update the `docker-compose.yml` file to run the application as a non-root user:

   ```yaml
   services:
     slink:
       image: anirdev/slink:latest
       user: slink
       # Your other configurations
   ```

4. Then you can proceed with the [installation guide](/installation/01-docker-compose).

</Steps>

<Aside type="note">
  Slink doesn't controll the end user infrastructure, therefore cannot enforce
  running the application as a non-root user. The above steps are
  recommendations to improve the security of the application.

<Aside type="tip">
  The `1000:1000` user and group IDs correspond to the `slink` user inside the container. You can find the user and group IDs by running the following command inside the container:

```bash
docker exec -it slink id
```
