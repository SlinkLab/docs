description: How to override server configuration for Slink.

If you need to override the PHP configuration, you can do so by mounting a custom `php.ini` file to the `/usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/` directory in the container.

Here is an example of how you can override the `upload_max_filesize` and `post_max_size` settings:

```yaml
slink:
  # Your existing configuration
  volumes:
    # Your existing volumes

    # Overriding this file will allow to overcome the default 50M upload limit
    # Change the values according to your needs for both upload_max_filesize and post_max_size
    - ./custom-php.ini:/usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/uploads.ini
```
