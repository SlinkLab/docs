Slink runs on a containerized environment with pre-configured PHP and web server settings. However, you may need to customize these settings for your specific deployment requirements.

## PHP Configuration Overrides

If you need to override PHP configuration, you can mount custom configuration files to the `/usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/` directory in the container.

### Common PHP Overrides

#### File Upload Limits

To increase file upload limits beyond the default values:

**Create a custom PHP configuration file (`custom-php.ini`):**

```ini
; File upload settings
upload_max_filesize = 100M
post_max_size = 100M
max_file_uploads = 20

; Memory and execution limits
memory_limit = 512M
max_execution_time = 300
max_input_time = 300

; File handling
file_uploads = On
```

**Mount it in your Docker Compose configuration:**

```yaml
services:
  slink:
    image: anirdev/slink:latest
    volumes:
      # Your existing volumes
      - ./slink/var/data:/app/var/data
      - ./slink/images:/app/slink/images
      
      # Custom PHP configuration
      - ./custom-php.ini:/usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/uploads.ini
    # ... rest of your configuration
```

<Aside type="caution">
  Ensure that your `IMAGE_MAX_SIZE` environment variable doesn't exceed the PHP `upload_max_filesize` and `post_max_size` limits.

## Web Server Configuration

The default container uses a built-in web server. For advanced web server configurations or reverse proxy setups, see the [Reverse Proxy](/installation/02-reverse-proxy) guide.

## Configuration Validation

After applying custom configurations, verify they're working correctly:

```bash
# Check PHP configuration
docker exec -it slink php -i | grep upload_max_filesize

# Check if your application is responding
curl -I http://localhost:3000/api/health

# View application logs
docker logs slink
```

<Aside type="tip">
  Always test configuration changes in a development environment before applying them to production.
