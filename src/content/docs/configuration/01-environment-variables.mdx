<Aside type="tip">
  Most of the environment variables on this page could be accessed via the
  application's [settings](/configuration/02-admin-settings-page) page.

The application can be configured using environment variables.
Simply set the environment variables when starting the Docker container or in your `docker-compose.yml` when using Docker Compose.
